# 4 september 2022
i started this project.

# steps
i want to get the API server (so our main focus is react js axios , so right now we wil just copy).
Note : later, we have to build API server also.

i got the api server from this link
https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/NodeJSForStudents/tree/main/MongoDB_API_CRUD_HelloWorld

Next 

run the api server 
test it with postman

1) dummy car is working fine

we  have a problem dummycar i sworking finr but movied indexing is not working.

may be because of,

1. database is down.
2. database connection is not good.

IP address was a problem.
added current ip address from mongodb dashboard.
